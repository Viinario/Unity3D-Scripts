# Unity3D Multi-Use Scripts Repository

Welcome to the **Unity3D Multi-Use Scripts** repository! This collection is designed to provide reusable scripts for Unity developers. These scripts are suitable for a variety of projects, especially those involving dynamic movement, camera handling, and object interactions in 3D environments.

---

## Scripts Overview

### 1. **CameraFollow.cs**  
A script to make the camera smoothly follow and rotate with a target object, ensuring immersive and dynamic gameplay visuals.  
- **Features**:
  - Smooth position and rotation interpolation.
  - Customizable camera offset.
  - Ideal for third-person or dynamic chase camera setups.  
- **Example Use**: Spaceships or characters being tracked by a camera.  

---

### 2. **SpaceshipController.cs**  
Controls a spaceship's movement, including forward/backward thrust, rotation, vertical movement, and a speed boost mode.  
- **Features**:
  - Basic flight mechanics with adjustable speed and rotation.
  - Smooth vertical movement using keyboard inputs.
  - Speed boost functionality for rapid traversal.  
- **Example Use**: Space exploration games or flight simulators.

---

### 3. **Satelite.cs**  
Manages the orbit and rotation of a satellite (e.g., a moon around a planet).  
- **Features**:
  - Simulates realistic orbital mechanics.
  - Adjustable orbit radius and speed.
  - Smooth self-rotation for added realism.  
- **Example Use**: Space simulations or educational applications about planetary motion.

---

### 4. **PlanetMovement.cs**  
Handles the rotation and orbit of planets around a central object (e.g., the Sun).  
- **Features**:
  - Independent planet rotation and revolution mechanics.
  - Customizable orbit radius and speeds.
  - Seamless movement along defined axes.  
- **Example Use**: Solar system visualizations or cosmic strategy games.
